Driver Component
================

The driver component contains some convenience modules that can be used to help
construct the driver layer of an application. Applications can use some or all
of the driver component, mixing and matching as necessary.

Bear in mind that the driver component only supports typical usage. If your specific
needs are not covered, then your application will need its own specific driver code.
The driver component may act as a starting point for application specific driver code,
but it should not be modified with any application specific logic.
